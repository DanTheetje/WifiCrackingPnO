Project 
1.   a. Install Kali on one of the Raspberry Pi.
     b. Setup one of the router to create a LAN (LAN1).
     c. Demonstrate that it works by ssh from one of your own laptop to one of the pi.
2.   a. Use the aircrack suite to crack the password of the router (setup in WEP).
     b. Implement a simple sniffer suff module
3. Setup the second router (LAN2) and a pi which hosts a website (that has a database managed using SQL). Access the website hosted in LAN2 from LAN1.
4. Implement the man in the middle attack using ARP poisoning.
5. Modify the website "on the fly" to demonstrate the MITM attack works.
