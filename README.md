Welcome to team ESAT2A1's github page where our code for the project "Crack the Wi-Fi" can be found. This project is part of the course "Problem Solving and Design Part 3" of the Engineering Bachelor of the Catholic University Leuven.


The assignment :
1.   a. Install Kali on one of the Raspberry Pi.
     b. Setup one of the router to create a LAN (LAN1).
     c. Demonstrate that it works by ssh from one of your own laptop to one of the pi.
2.   a. Use the aircrack suite to crack the password of the router (setup in WEP).
     b. Implement a simple sniffer suff module
3. Setup the second router (LAN2) and a pi which hosts a website (that has a database managed using SQL). Access the website hosted in LAN2 from LAN1.
4. Implement the man in the middle attack using ARP poisoning.
5. Modify the website "on the fly" to demonstrate how the MITM attack works.

In this GitHub, code for following operations can be found:
 - Sniffing and decrypting WEP packages
 - A dummy HTTP forumsite that was hacked in our demonstration
 - A Man In The Middle attack

All code was run on Raspberry Pies 3

Cheers,
Team ESAT2A1
